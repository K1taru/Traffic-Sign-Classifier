# App/input/

This folder is intended for temporary or user-provided input data required by the application. Typical contents may include images, CSV files, or other data files used for testing, inference, or running the app. Since these files can be large, frequently changing, or specific to your local environment, it's recommended to exclude this folder from version control.

**Common uses:**
- Storing input data for model inference
- Uploads or files provided by users
- Temporary files generated during app usage

# App/model/

This folder is dedicated to storing the single, production-ready model that will be used by the application. Only one finalized model file should be placed here, and this file will be tracked and uploaded to GitHub as part of the repository.

**Guidelines:**
- Store only the final, production-ready model here (e.g., `model.pt`, `model.h5`, etc.).
- Do not use this folder for temporary checkpoints, experimental models, or large intermediate files.
- The model in this folder should be versioned and maintained as the official model artifact for deployment or sharing.
